        Currently, I work as a hands-on Tech Lead, providing technical
        leadership while actively contributing to development alongside the
        team. My approach combines strategic vision with technical execution,
        directly supporting architectural decisions, code reviews, and solving
        complex problems. I’m actively involved in sprint planning and task
        prioritization, fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous
        improvement.

        With a strong technical foundation and well-developed leadership skills,
        I’m able to align technology with business goals to deliver efficient,
        accessible solutions that have a high impact on users and companies. I
        apply agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to optimize
        processes, strengthen team communication, and ensure consistent
        deliveries within established deadlines.
